# AI Features Implementation Status

This document outlines the implementation status of all AI-powered features in the Jobraker backend.

## 1. Job Matching and Recommendations

### 1.1. User-to-Job Matching

-   **Status:** Implemented
-   **Description:** The `JobMatchService` in `apps/jobs/services.py` provides functionality to find matching jobs for a user based on their profile embedding. The `find_matching_jobs_for_user` method queries the vector database to find jobs with similar embeddings to the user's profile.
-   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/jobs/generate-recommendations/` triggers the generation of new recommendations.
-   **Files:**
    -   `apps/jobs/services.py` (JobMatchService)
    -   `apps/jobs/views.py` (GenerateRecommendationsView)
    -   `apps/common/vector_service.py` (VectorDBService)

### 1.2. Job-to-Job Similarity

-   **Status:** Implemented
-   **Description:** A new method `find_similar_jobs` has been added to `JobMatchService` to find jobs similar to a given job. This uses the job's own embedding to find other jobs with similar embeddings.
-   **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/jobs/{id}/similar/`
-   **Files:**
    -   `apps/jobs/services.py` (JobMatchService)
    -   `apps/jobs/views.py` (JobViewSet)

## 2. Embedding Generation

-   **Status:** Implemented
-   **Description:** The `EmbeddingService` in `apps/integrations/services/openai_service.py` handles the generation of text embeddings using the OpenAI API. Celery tasks in `apps/integrations/tasks.py` use this service to generate and store embeddings for jobs and user profiles asynchronously.
-   **Files:**
    -   `apps/integrations/services/openai_service.py` (EmbeddingService)
    -   `apps/integrations/tasks.py` (e.g., `generate_embedding_for_job_task`)

## 3. AI-Powered Chat Assistant

-   **Status:** Implemented (Backend)
-   **Description:** The `OpenAIJobAssistant` service in `apps/integrations/services/openai_service.py` provides chat completion functionality. The `ChatViewSet` in `apps/chat/views.py` handles chat sessions and messages, queuing tasks for the AI to generate responses.
-   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/chat/sessions/{session_id}/send/`
-   **Files:**
    -   `apps/integrations/services/openai_service.py` (OpenAIJobAssistant)
    -   `apps/chat/views.py` (ChatViewSet)
    -   `apps/integrations/tasks.py` (`get_openai_chat_response_task`)

## 4. Resume Analysis

-   **Status:** Implemented (Backend)
-   **Description:** The backend is set up to receive a resume, and the `analyze_openai_resume_task` Celery task in `apps/integrations/tasks.py` can be used to send the resume text to the OpenAI API for analysis.
-   **API Endpoint:** No direct endpoint yet. This is typically triggered after a file upload.
-   **Files:**
    -   `apps/integrations/tasks.py` (`analyze_openai_resume_task`)

## 5. Automated Job Applications (Skyvern)

-   **Status:** Partially Implemented
-   **Description:** The `AutoApplyView` exists, but the core logic to integrate with Skyvern for automated applications is marked as a TODO. The necessary Celery tasks for interacting with the Skyvern API are present in `apps/integrations/tasks.py`.
-   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/jobs/auto-apply/`
-   **Files:**
    -   `apps/jobs/views.py` (AutoApplyView)
    -   `apps/integrations/tasks.py` (`run_skyvern_application_task`)

## Summary of Pending Work

-   **Frontend Integration:** Connect the frontend to the new `/api/jobs/{id}/similar/` endpoint.
-   **Skyvern Integration:** Complete the implementation of the `AutoApplyView` to fully integrate with the Skyvern service for automated job applications.
-   **Resume Upload:** Implement a file upload endpoint for resumes that triggers the `analyze_openai_resume_task`.
-   **Testing:** Add more comprehensive tests for the new AI features.
