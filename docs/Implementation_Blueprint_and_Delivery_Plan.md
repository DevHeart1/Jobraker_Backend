## 2. Guiding Principles & Development Philosophy

Our development process is underpinned by the following core principles to ensure quality, agility, and resilience:

| Principle                 | Implementation Tactic & Rationale                                                                                                                               |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Iterate Safely & Rapidly  | Employ short, vertical slices of functionality, enabling frequent integration and feedback. Utilize feature flags and canary releases for controlled rollouts and risk mitigation. |
| Asynchronous by Default   | Mandate that any operation involving network I/O or with an execution time potentially exceeding 250ms be processed asynchronously via Celery. This preserves API responsiveness and enhances user experience. |
| Observability First       | Embed telemetry hooks (e.g., Prometheus client, Sentry SDK) as an integral part of every new service or significant feature. Comprehensive observability is non-negotiable for proactive issue detection and performance analysis. |
| Shift-Left on Security    | Integrate security practices early in the development lifecycle. This includes automated static analysis (e.g., Bandit), secrets scanning, and Row-Level Security (RLS) tests as part of the CI pipeline. |
| Cost Awareness & Optimization | Implement mechanisms for daily tracking of OpenAI and Render service expenditures, with data visualized in Grafana. Configure automated alerts when spending approaches 80% of the allocated budget to ensure financial prudence. |
| Test-Driven Development (TDD) | Encourage writing tests before or alongside feature code to ensure correctness and facilitate refactoring. Aim for high test coverage across unit, integration, and E2E tests. |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC) | Manage and provision all cloud infrastructure (Render services, configurations) through version-controlled code (e.g., `render.yaml`) to ensure consistency, repeatability, and auditability. |
| Continuous Improvement    | Foster a culture of regular retrospectives and knowledge sharing to identify areas for process improvement, technological enhancements, and skill development. |

## 6. Comprehensive Testing Strategy & Matrix

A multi-layered testing strategy is crucial for ensuring the quality, reliability, and security of the Jobraker platform.

| Testing Layer     | Tools & Frameworks                     | Coverage Goal | Key Areas & Examples                                                                                                | Owner       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------- |
| **Unit Testing**  | `pytest`, `unittest.mock`              | > 90%         | Models (validation, methods), Services (business logic), Helpers, Utils. Mock external dependencies.                | Backend Eng |
| **Integration Testing** | `pytest`, `APIClient` (DRF), `testcontainers` (Postgres, Redis), `Celery` (testing utilities) | > 70%         | API endpoint behavior, service interactions, Celery task execution with real broker/DB, RLS enforcement.             | Backend Eng |
| **End-to-End (E2E) Testing** | `Cypress` (frontend-driven), `Playwright` (Python-driven for specific backend flows) | Key User Flows | User registration & login, job search & manual apply, auto-apply (mocked Skyvern), AI chat interaction, admin functions. | QA Engineer |
| **Load Testing**  | `Locust`                               | Target SLA    | API endpoint performance under concurrent load (p95 latency, error rates), Celery worker scalability.               | QA, DevOps  |
| **Security Testing** | `Bandit` (SAST), `Safety` (dependencies), `OWASP ZAP` (DAST), Manual Pen-Testing (external) | Critical/High Vulns = 0 | SQLi, XSS, auth/authz bypass, insecure direct object references, prompt injection, sensitive data exposure.         | SecOff, QA  |
| **Contract Testing** | `Pact` (or similar, if frontend/microservices adopt) | API Contracts | Ensure backend API changes don't break frontend consumers (and vice-versa if applicable).                             | Backend, Frontend |
| **Chaos Engineering** | Manual experiments, potentially `Chaos Toolkit` later | Key Services  | Resilience of Celery workers, database connections, external API integrations to transient failures.                  | DevOps, QA  |

**Testing Pyramid:** Emphasis on a strong base of unit tests, followed by integration tests, with fewer, more targeted E2E tests.

Blue/green deployment strategy preferred. |
| **Environment Variables & Secrets** | Render Environment Groups (for staging/production). Local development uses `.env` files (gitignored) loaded by `python-dotenv` or `.envrc` with `direnv`. | DevOps, All Eng | Secrets (API keys, DB passwords) are never hardcoded. Environment Groups provide secure storage and injection at runtime.                 |
| **Database Schema Management** | Django Migrations (`python manage.py makemigrations`, `migrate`).                                                | Backend Eng    | All schema changes version-controlled via migrations. An auto-generated SQL baseline can be exported periodically for documentation. |

| **Infrastructure Testing**    | `Terratest` (or similar) for smoke tests post-deployment to validate basic infrastructure health and connectivity. | DevOps         | Simple tests to confirm services are up, health checks pass, and basic API calls succeed after a new deployment.                    |
| **Static Assets & Media**   | Configuration for serving static files (whitenoise or CDN) and media files (Render Disks or external S3-compatible like Cloudflare R2). | DevOps         | Ensure efficient delivery and proper cache settings.                                                                                |
