    - **Session Management**: Store user session data for quick authentication checks if not using purely stateless JWTs for all session aspects.
    - **Frequently Accessed Data**: Cache user profiles, popular job listings, or system configurations.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Store counters for API rate limiting.
    - **Celery Message Broker**: (See Section 7.2)
    - **Distributed Locks**: For coordinating tasks among multiple workers.

## 7. Asynchronous Task Processing

### 7.1. Task Queue: Celery
- **Version**: 5.x+
- **Why Celery?**: Celery is a distributed task queue system that allows for asynchronous execution of tasks outside the main application's request-response cycle. This is critical for:
    - **Improving API Response Times**: Offloading long-running operations (e.g., API calls, complex computations, email sending).
    - **Background Processing**: Handling tasks like job scraping, application submissions, and AI model inferences without blocking user interactions.
    - **Scalability**: Celery workers can be scaled independently to handle varying task loads.
    - **Reliability**: Supports task retries, error handling, and monitoring.
- **Key Tasks Managed by Celery**:
    - **Job Search Fetching**: Periodically fetching new job listings from Adzuna and other sources.
    - **Auto-Apply Submissions**: Automating job application submissions via the Skyvern API.
    - **AI Chat Completions & Embeddings**: Processing requests to the OpenAI API for chat responses and generating text embeddings.
    - **Notification Delivery**: Sending email or push notifications.
    - **Data Processing & Aggregation**: Performing batch operations or analytics.

- **Role**: Manages the queue of tasks, ensuring that tasks are delivered from the Django application (producer) to the Celery workers (consumers).

### 7.3. Scheduler: Celery Beat
- **Why Celery Beat?**: Celery Beat is a scheduler that triggers tasks at regular intervals.
- **Scheduled Tasks**:
    - **Periodic Job Listing Fetch**: e.g., every 30 minutes to an hour to retrieve fresh job listings from Adzuna.
    - **Auto-Apply Job Check**: e.g., hourly, to identify and process jobs meeting user auto-apply criteria.
    - **Data Maintenance Tasks**: e.g., daily cleanup of old logs or temporary data.
    - **Report Generation**: e.g., daily or weekly generation of system performance reports.

## 8. Real-Time Communication

### 8.1. WebSockets: Django Channels (Optional / Future Enhancement)
- **Why WebSockets?**: To enable bi-directional, real-time communication between the client (frontend) and the backend.
- **Potential Use Cases**:
    - **Live Chat**: For the AI-powered assistant, providing instant responses.
    - **Real-time Notifications**: Instant updates on job application status, new relevant jobs, or interview reminders without requiring page reloads.
    - **Collaborative Features**: (If any are planned in the future).
