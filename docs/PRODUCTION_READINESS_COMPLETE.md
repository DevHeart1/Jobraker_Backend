## 🛠️ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDE**

### **1. Environment Setup**
```bash
# Copy and configure production environment
cp .env.production.template .env.production
# Edit .env.production with your production values

# Set up PostgreSQL with pgvector
chmod +x setup_postgresql_pgvector.sh
sudo ./setup_postgresql_pgvector.sh
```

### **2. Production Deployment**
```bash
# Run production deployment script
chmod +x deploy_production.sh
sudo ./deploy_production.sh
```

### **3. Service Management**
```bash
# Start services
sudo systemctl start jobraker-web jobraker-celery jobraker-celery-beat

# Enable auto-start
sudo systemctl enable jobraker-web jobraker-celery jobraker-celery-beat

# Monitor services
sudo journalctl -u jobraker-web -f
```

### **4. Health Verification**
```bash
# Check application health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/notifications/health/production/

# Check system metrics
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/notifications/metrics/production/
```
