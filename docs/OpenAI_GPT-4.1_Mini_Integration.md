## 3. Core Use Cases in Jobraker

GPT-4.1 Mini is integral to several key functionalities within the Jobraker AI Chat feature.

### 3.1 AI Chatbot for Enhanced Job Seeker Support
The model empowers a conversational interface providing multifaceted support:

#### 3.1.1 Real-time Application Status Tracking
Users can query the status of their submitted job applications (e.g., "What's the status of my application to Company X?"). GPT-4.1 Mini, through function calling, interacts with the Jobraker backend to fetch and relay the latest application status.

#### 3.1.2 Intelligent Interview Coordination
The AI assists in scheduling interviews by accessing available slots (via function calls to an internal or external calendar API) and coordinating with the user's stated availability.

#### 3.1.3 Personalized Job Recommendations
Leveraging user profile data (skills, experience, preferences) and job market information retrieved via RAG, GPT-4.1 Mini suggests suitable job openings tailored to the individual user.

#### 3.1.4 Constructive Resume Feedback
Users can request feedback on their resumes. While direct image upload for parsing is a multimodal feature (see 3.3), text-based resume content can be analyzed for common improvements, keyword optimization, and structural suggestions.

#### 3.1.5 Contextual Career Guidance
The AI offers general career advice, tips on skill development, insights into job market trends, and interview preparation strategies, drawing upon its general knowledge and RAG-retrieved information.

### 3.2 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Contextual Accuracy

To ground GPT-4.1 Mini's responses in factual and Jobraker-specific data, a RAG pipeline is implemented.

#### 3.2.1 RAG Pipeline Architecture
1.  **User Query:** The user's message is received.
2.  **Embedding Generation:** The query is converted into a vector embedding.
3.  **Vector Search:** The embedding is used to search a `pgvector` database containing embeddings of job descriptions, company profiles, historical user interactions, and curated career advice documents.
4.  **Context Retrieval:** Top-N relevant document chunks are retrieved.
5.  **Prompt Augmentation:** The retrieved context is combined with the original user query and system prompts to form an augmented prompt for GPT-4.1 Mini.
6.  **Response Generation:** GPT-4.1 Mini generates a response based on the augmented prompt.

#### 3.2.2 Vector Database Integration
Jobraker utilizes `pgvector`, a PostgreSQL extension, for storing and searching embeddings. This choice aligns with the primary database technology, simplifying the stack and data management. Embeddings are generated for:
*   Job listings (description, requirements).
*   User profiles (skills, experience summaries - with user consent).
*   Internal knowledge base articles (career advice, FAQs).

### 3.3 Leveraging Multimodal Capabilities (Text and Image Input)

GPT-4.1 Mini's support for image inputs enables innovative features:

#### 3.3.1 Automated Resume Information Extraction
Users can upload an image of their resume. GPT-4.1 Mini processes the image to extract key information (contact details, work experience, education, skills), which can then be used to pre-fill or update their Jobraker user profile. This requires careful handling of image data and clear user consent.

#### 3.3.2 Visual Job Description Analysis
The AI can analyze images of job descriptions (e.g., screenshots from non-standardized career pages). It extracts text and structure to identify key requirements, responsibilities, and company details, facilitating better matching against user profiles.

#### 3.3.3 Interactive Mock Interview Simulations
(Potential Future Use with Image/Audio) Users could engage in mock interviews where the AI evaluates not only textual responses but potentially visual cues (if video input becomes supported and ethically implemented) or vocal tonality (with audio input). Currently, text-based mock interviews with feedback are feasible.

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### 4.1 OpenAI API Integration

#### 4.1.1 Client Library and Authentication
Jobraker interacts with the GPT-4.1 Mini API using the official `openai` Python client library. Authentication is handled via API keys, which are securely stored using Render Environment Groups and managed by the `IntegrationService` within the backend.

#### 4.1.2 API Request Structure (ChatCompletion)
The primary endpoint used is `openai.ChatCompletion.create`. A typical request includes:

```python
# Example (conceptual, actual implementation in IntegrationService)
# import openai # Ensure client is initialized with API key

# user_query = "Tell me about software engineering roles in Berlin."
# retrieved_rag_context = "Software engineering in Berlin is booming..." # From pgvector
# conversation_history = [
#    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi there!"},
#    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! How can I help you today?"}
# ]

# messages_payload = conversation_history + [
#     {"role": "system", "content": f"You are Jobraker AI, a helpful assistant. Here's some context to help answer the user: {retrieved_rag_context}"}, # Context injected here
#     {"role": "user", "content": user_query}
# ]

# response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
#   model="gpt-4.1-mini",
#   messages=messages_payload,
#   max_tokens=1000, # Example value
#   temperature=0.7 # Example value
# )

# ai_response_content = response.choices[0].message.content
```

**Note:** The `context_data` parameter mentioned in the input is not a direct parameter of `ChatCompletion.create`. Context from RAG is typically injected into the `messages` payload, often as part of a system message or by augmenting the user's message.

#### 4.1.3 Contextual Data Injection for RAG
As shown in the example above, context retrieved from the `pgvector` database via the RAG pipeline is formatted and included within the `messages` array sent to the API. This ensures the model has the necessary information to generate relevant and accurate responses.

### 4.2 Function Calling for Actionable Intelligence

GPT-4.1 Mini's function calling capability allows it to interact with other Jobraker backend services or external APIs in a structured way.

#### 4.2.1 Defining Callable Functions
Functions are defined to the model within the API request, specifying their name, description, and parameters. For example, a function to get application status:

```json
// Part of the API request to OpenAI
{
  "name": "getApplicationStatus",
  "description": "Get the current status of a user's job application to a specific company.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "companyName": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The name of the company the user applied to."
      },
      "jobTitle": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The title of the job applied for (optional)."
      }
    },
    "required": ["companyName"]
  }
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Workflow for Function Execution
1.  User makes a request (e.g., "What's my application status for Acme Corp?").
2.  Jobraker backend sends the query and defined functions to GPT-4.1 Mini.
3.  If the model determines a function should be called, its response will include a `function_call` object with the function name and arguments (e.g., `{"name": "getApplicationStatus", "arguments": "{\\"companyName\\": \\"Acme Corp\\"}"}`).
4.  The Jobraker backend parses this, executes the local `getApplicationStatus` function (which queries the database).
5.  The result of the local function execution is then sent back to GPT-4.1 Mini in a subsequent request (with `role: "function"`).
6.  GPT-4.1 Mini uses this result to formulate a natural language response to the user.

#### 4.2.3 Example: Interview Scheduling via Calendar API
If a user requests to schedule an interview, a `scheduleInterview` function could be defined. GPT-4.1 Mini would determine the necessary parameters (e.g., date, time, interviewee) from the conversation, request to call the function, and Jobraker's backend would then interact with an internal or external calendar API to perform the scheduling.

### 4.3 Safety, Moderation, and Ethical AI

Ensuring safe, responsible, and ethical AI interactions is paramount.

#### 4.3.1 Prompt Engineering and Instruction Hierarchy
System prompts are carefully engineered to guide the model's behavior, define its persona (Jobraker AI), and set boundaries. OpenAI's "instruction hierarchy" techniques are employed to improve resistance to prompt injections and system prompt extraction, making the AI more robust against adversarial inputs.

#### 4.3.2 OpenAI Content Moderation API Usage
All user inputs and, critically, model-generated responses can be passed through OpenAI's Moderation API (`text-moderation-latest`) before being displayed to the user. This helps filter out harmful, inappropriate, or policy-violating content across various categories.

#### 4.3.3 Handling Sensitive User Data
*   **Minimization:** Only necessary user data is included in prompts.
*   **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Where possible, sensitive identifiers are anonymized or pseudonymized before being sent to the API.
*   **Consent:** Users are informed about how their data is used by the AI feature, and consent is obtained where necessary (e.g., for resume parsing).
*   **Data Retention:** Policies for chat log retention and API request logging align with privacy best practices and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR).

#### 4.3.4 Bias Mitigation Strategies
While GPT-4.1 Mini has undergone safety training, ongoing monitoring for potential biases in responses is crucial. Feedback mechanisms allow users to report biased or unfair responses, which are reviewed to refine prompts or report issues to OpenAI. Diverse datasets for RAG also help in providing balanced information.

## 5. Performance, Scalability, and Cost Management

### 5.1 Performance Characteristics
GPT-4.1 Mini is selected for its lower latency compared to larger GPT-4 models. Target response times for AI Chat interactions (including RAG retrieval and API call) are aimed to be within a few seconds to maintain a fluid user experience. Performance is continuously monitored using Prometheus metrics for API call duration and overall task processing time.

### 5.2 Scalability Considerations for AI Chat Service
The AI Chat feature, being reliant on external API calls and potentially intensive RAG queries, is designed for scalability:
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** OpenAI API calls are made via Celery tasks to prevent blocking web server threads.
*   **Worker Scaling:** Celery workers dedicated to AI tasks can be scaled horizontally based on queue length or processing demand.
*   **Database Optimization:** `pgvector` queries for RAG are optimized with appropriate indexing (e.g., IVFFlat or HNSW).
*   **Rate Limiting:** Adherence to OpenAI API rate limits is managed by the `IntegrationService`, with retry mechanisms and potential queuing.

### 5.3 Cost Optimization Strategies

Managing the operational costs of using OpenAI APIs is critical.

#### 5.3.1 Token Usage Monitoring and Budgeting
*   The number of input and output tokens for each API call is logged.
*   Daily and monthly spend is tracked via Prometheus metrics and visualized in Grafana.
*   Alerts are configured (e.g., via Alertmanager) if spending approaches predefined budget thresholds (e.g., 80% of monthly budget).

#### 5.3.2 Prompt Optimization
*   Prompts are engineered to be concise yet effective to minimize input token count.
*   The `max_tokens` parameter for responses is carefully set based on the expected output length to avoid excessive output token usage.
*   Conversation history sent with requests is truncated or summarized if it becomes too long.

#### 5.3.3 Potential for Model Tier Adjustments
If cost becomes a significant concern, and depending on the specific needs of a query, Jobraker may implement logic to dynamically choose a less expensive model (e.g., a fine-tuned smaller model or an older GPT series if appropriate for simpler queries) as a fallback, though GPT-4.1 Mini is already positioned for cost-efficiency.
