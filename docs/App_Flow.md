## 2. User Onboarding and Identity Management Flow

This flow details the processes for user registration, authentication, and profile management, emphasizing security, data integrity, and user experience.

**Actors:**
*   **User:** The individual interacting with the Jobraker platform.
*   **Jobraker Backend System:** The server-side application logic.
*   **External OAuth Providers:** Google, LinkedIn (if used).

**Step 1: Secure User Registration**

*   **Actor:** User, Jobraker Backend System, External OAuth Providers (optional).
*   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/register/`
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   User has access to the registration interface.
    *   User has a valid email address.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **User Input:** User provides essential credentials (email, a strong password meeting defined complexity policies) and initial job preferences (e.g., desired role, primary location).
    2.  **Backend Validation:** The system performs rigorous input validation (format, length, required fields) and sanitization to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
    3.  **OAuth Integration (Optional):** If the user selects OAuth (Google/LinkedIn), the flow redirects to the provider. `django-allauth` handles the OAuth 2.0 handshake. Upon successful external authentication, the system retrieves user information from the provider.
    4.  **Account Creation:** A new `User` account is created in the database. A unique user ID is generated. If OAuth is used, the external provider's ID is linked.
    5.  **Email Verification:** A verification email containing a unique, time-sensitive token is dispatched to the user's registered email address to confirm account ownership and email validity. (Post-condition: User account may be in an 'unverified' state until confirmed).
    6.  **Token Issuance:** Upon successful registration (and potentially email verification, depending on policy), a short-lived JWT access token and a long-lived refresh token are issued.
        *   **Security Note:** Refresh tokens should be stored securely (e.g., `HttpOnly` cookies) to mitigate XSS risks. Access tokens are sent in the response body or headers.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   A new `User` record is created (potentially in an 'unverified' state).
    *   An initial `UserProfile` record may be created.
    *   JWT access and refresh tokens are provided to the user.
    *   A verification email is sent.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `User` (from `django.contrib.auth.models`), `UserProfile`, potentially `EmailAddress` (from `allauth`).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Invalid input data (400 Bad Request).
    *   Email already registered (409 Conflict).
    *   OAuth provider error.
    *   Email sending failure (logged, user might be prompted to resend).

**Step 2: Comprehensive User Profile Enrichment**

*   **Actor:** User, Jobraker Backend System.
*   **API Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v1/users/profile/` (typically using the user's ID, e.g., `/api/v1/users/me/profile/`)
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   User is authenticated.
    *   User account exists.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **User Input:** Post-registration or at the user's convenience, the user is prompted/allowed to complete their profile via a dedicated interface.
    2.  **Data Collection:** Information includes professional experience, educational background, technical skills (potentially as structured data or tags), certifications, resume/CV upload, and auto-application consent and parameters (e.g., match score threshold).
    3.  **Resume Handling:**
        *   Resume files are uploaded to secure storage (e.g., S3-compatible object storage).
        *   **Security Note:** Uploaded files are scanned for malware before processing.
        *   The system may parse the resume (e.g., using a Celery task) to extract keywords, skills, and experience, populating relevant profile fields.
    4.  **Data Persistence:** Profile data is validated and persisted in the `UserProfile` model, linked to the core `User` model.
    5.  **Impact Analysis:** Changes to profile data (especially skills, experience, preferences) trigger a re-evaluation of existing job match scores and may generate new personalized job recommendations.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   `UserProfile` record is updated with comprehensive information.
    *   Resume file is securely stored.
    *   Job matching algorithms may be triggered.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `UserProfile`, `User`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Invalid input data (400 Bad Request).
    *   File upload errors (size limits, type restrictions).
    *   Resume parsing failures (logged).

**Step 3: Robust User Authentication & Session Management**

*   **Actor:** User, Jobraker Backend System, External OAuth Providers (optional).
*   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/login/`
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   User account exists and is active (and verified, if required).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **User Credentials:** User attempts to log in using email/password or an active OAuth session.
    2.  **Credential Verification:**
        *   For email/password: Credentials are securely verified against stored password hashes (e.g., using Argon2, scrypt, or PBKDF2 via Django's password management).
        *   **Security Note:** Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms (e.g., after N failed attempts) to mitigate brute-force attacks.
    3.  **OAuth Login:** If OAuth is used, `django-allauth` handles the authentication flow with the provider.
    4.  **Token Issuance:** Upon successful authentication, new JWT access and refresh tokens are issued.
    5.  **Activity Logging:** Session activity (login timestamp, IP address) is logged for security auditing purposes.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   User is authenticated.
    *   New JWT access and refresh tokens are provided to the user.
    *   Session activity is logged.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `User`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Invalid credentials (401 Unauthorized).
    *   Account locked or inactive (403 Forbidden).
    *   OAuth provider error.

**Step 4: Token Refresh**

*   **Actor:** User Client Application, Jobraker Backend System.
*   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/token/refresh/`
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   User possesses a valid, non-expired refresh token.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Client application sends the refresh token to the endpoint.
    2.  Backend validates the refresh token (signature, expiry, not revoked).
    3.  If valid, a new short-lived JWT access token is issued. Optionally, the refresh token itself can be rotated for enhanced security.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   A new JWT access token is provided to the client.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** (Indirectly, token blacklist/revocation list if implemented).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Invalid or expired refresh token (401 Unauthorized).

## 3. Intelligent Job Discovery Flow

This flow describes how users search for jobs and how the system ingests, processes, and delivers relevant, personalized job listings.

**Actors:**
*   **User:** The individual searching for jobs.
*   **Jobraker Backend System:** Handles job ingestion, processing, searching, and scoring.
*   **Celery Worker:** Asynchronous task executor.
*   **External Job Aggregators:** Adzuna API (and potentially others).

**Step 1: Aggregated Job Listings Ingestion & Pre-processing**

*   **Actor:** Celery Worker (scheduled task), Jobraker Backend System, External Job Aggregators.
*   **Celery Task:** `fetch_external_jobs` (or similar)
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   Valid API credentials for external job aggregators are configured.
    *   Celery Beat scheduler is running.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Scheduled Execution:** A Celery task, scheduled via Celery Beat (e.g., every 30 minutes), initiates the job ingestion process.
    2.  **API Query:** The task queries the Adzuna API (and any other configured aggregators) for new and updated job listings based on broad, predefined criteria (e.g., locations, general keywords). Pagination is handled to retrieve all relevant listings.
    3.  **Data Transformation & Normalization:** Raw job data received from APIs is transformed into a standardized internal format. This includes normalizing location data, company names, and job categories.
    4.  **Enrichment:** Data may be enriched with additional information (e.g., company size/industry from an internal database or another service).
    5.  **Duplicate Detection:** Mechanisms are in place to identify and handle duplicate job listings (e.g., based on job ID from the source, or a combination of title, company, and location). Duplicates are merged or discarded.
    6.  **Persistence:** Processed and unique job listings are stored in the `JobListing` database model.
        *   **Performance Note:** Bulk insert/update operations are used where possible for efficiency.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   `JobListing` table is updated with new/modified job listings.
    *   Raw data from external APIs is processed and standardized.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `JobListing`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   External API errors (timeouts, rate limits, authentication failures) are logged, and retries (with backoff) are implemented.
    *   Data transformation errors are logged.
    *   Persistent failures may trigger alerts to administrators.

**Step 2: Advanced Job Search & Filtering**

*   **Actor:** User, Jobraker Backend System.
*   **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/jobs/search/`
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   User is (optionally, for personalization) authenticated.
    *   Job listings are available in the database.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **User Query:** User submits search queries via the frontend, including keywords (title, skills, company), location, salary expectations, job type, experience level, etc.
    2.  **Request Handling:** The `JobSearchViewSet` (or similar DRF view) handles the incoming GET request.
    3.  **Query Sanitization & Parsing:** Input parameters are validated and sanitized. Search terms are parsed for querying.
    4.  **Semantic Search (Core Feature / Future Enhancement):**
        *   If user profile embeddings and job description embeddings exist (e.g., generated using OpenAI or Sentence Transformers via a Celery task during ingestion/profile update):
        *   The system utilizes `pgvector` (or a similar vector search engine) to find jobs whose description embeddings are semantically similar to the user's query or profile embedding.
    5.  **Keyword-Based Filtering:** The system performs robust keyword matching against indexed fields in the `JobListing` model (e.g., title, description, company name, tags).
    6.  **Personalized Job Match Scoring:**
        *   For each retrieved job listing, a matching score is computed against the authenticated user’s `UserProfile` (skills, experience, preferences, location).
        *   The scoring algorithm (e.g., `MatchService`) considers factors like skill overlap (weighted), experience alignment, location proximity, and salary range compatibility. This score helps rank results by relevance to the specific user.
    7.  **Caching Strategy:**
        *   **Performance Note:** Frequently accessed search results for common queries or popular filter combinations are cached in Redis (e.g., using `django-redis`).
        *   Cache keys are designed carefully (e.g., based on query parameters).
        *   Appropriate cache invalidation strategies (e.g., time-based, event-based on new job ingestion) are implemented to ensure data freshness.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   A list of job listings matching the search criteria is compiled.
    *   If the user is authenticated, jobs are scored based on their profile.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `JobListing`, `UserProfile` (for personalization).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Invalid search parameters (400 Bad Request).
    *   No results found (200 OK with an empty list).

**Step 3: Results Presentation & Refinement**

*   **Actor:** Jobraker Backend System, User.
*   **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/jobs/search/` (response part of the previous step)
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   A list of filtered and scored job listings is available from Step 2.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Serialization:** Filtered and scored job listings are serialized into JSON format by DRF serializers. Serializers ensure only necessary data is exposed and may include calculated fields like the match score.
    2.  **Pagination:** Results are paginated (e.g., 20 results per page) to ensure efficient delivery and manageable response sizes. Pagination metadata (total count, next/previous page links) is included.
    3.  **Client-Side Refinement:** The frontend allows users to further refine results using dynamic filters (e.g., date posted, company rating, specific skills) and sort by relevance, date, or match score. These actions may trigger new API requests.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   Paginated, serialized job listings are returned to the user's client.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** (Primarily presentation of `JobListing` data).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Serialization errors (logged as 500 Internal Server Error).

## 4. Automated Job Application (Auto-Apply) Flow

This flow details the system's capability to automatically apply for jobs on behalf of the user based on predefined criteria, emphasizing user control and transparency.

**Actors:**
*   **User:** Configures auto-apply settings.
*   **Jobraker Backend System:** Manages settings and orchestrates the auto-apply process.
*   **Celery Worker:** Executes the auto-apply evaluation and submission tasks.
*   **Skyvern API (or similar):** External service for performing automated application submissions.

**Step 1: User Configuration of Auto-Apply Preferences**

*   **Actor:** User, Jobraker Backend System.
*   **API Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/v1/users/profile/auto-apply-settings/`
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   User is authenticated.
    *   User has a sufficiently complete profile (including a resume).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **User Opt-In:** Users explicitly opt-in to the auto-apply feature through their profile settings.
        *   **Security/Consent Note:** Clear consent language is displayed, explaining what the feature does.
    2.  **Parameter Configuration:** Users define parameters for auto-application:
        *   Minimum job match score threshold (e.g., "only apply if my profile match score is > 80%").
        *   Frequency of auto-apply checks (if configurable by user, otherwise system-defined).
        *   Blacklisted companies or job titles (to avoid applying to certain employers).
        *   Optional: Confirmation requirements (e.g., "require my manual review before final submission for jobs in X industry" - advanced feature).
    3.  **Settings Persistence:** These settings are validated and stored securely in the `UserProfile` model.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   User's auto-apply preferences are saved in their `UserProfile`.
    *   User is now eligible for the auto-apply process if the feature is enabled.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `UserProfile`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Invalid input for settings (400 Bad Request).

**Step 2: Scheduled Job Auto-Apply Evaluation**

*   **Actor:** Celery Worker (scheduled task), Jobraker Backend System.
*   **Celery Task:** `process_auto_applications_for_user` (or similar, potentially one task per eligible user, or a batch task)
*   **Trigger:** Scheduled by Celery Beat (e.g., daily or hourly, based on system configuration or user preference).
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   User has opted-in to auto-apply and configured their settings.
    *   User's profile includes necessary information (resume, skills).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Identify Eligible Users:** The task iterates through users who have enabled auto-apply.
    2.  **Fetch Potential Jobs:** For each eligible user, the system fetches new job listings that:
        *   Match their basic search preferences (role, location - from `UserProfile`).
        *   Have not yet been applied to or explicitly dismissed by the user.
        *   **Performance Note:** This query should be optimized, possibly leveraging pre-filtered job lists or recent additions.
    3.  **Calculate Match Score:** Each potential job's match score is calculated against the user’s profile using the `MatchService`.
    4.  **Evaluate Criteria:** The system checks if the job’s match score exceeds the user-defined threshold and meets other criteria (not blacklisted, matches any other user-defined rules).
    5.  **Flag for Application:** Jobs meeting all criteria are flagged for auto-application. A list of (user_id, job_id) pairs is prepared.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   A set of jobs is identified as suitable for auto-application for specific users.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `UserProfile`, `JobListing`, `Application` (to check existing).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Errors during job fetching or match score calculation are logged. The process continues for other users/jobs where possible.

**Step 3: Automated Application Submission via Skyvern API**

*   **Actor:** Celery Worker (submission task), Jobraker Backend System, Skyvern API.
*   **Celery Task:** `submit_skyvern_application` (or similar, triggered by Step 2 for each flagged job)
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   A job has been flagged for auto-application for a specific user.
    *   Valid Skyvern API credentials are configured.
    *   User's resume and necessary profile data are available.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Task Dispatch:** For each job flagged in Step 2, a dedicated Celery sub-task is dispatched to handle the application submission to avoid one failure blocking others.
    2.  **Data Retrieval:** The system securely retrieves the user’s resume URL and relevant profile data (contact info, experience snippets if needed by Skyvern).
    3.  **Skyvern API Request:** A request is made to the Skyvern API, providing job details (URL, ID) and user information. Skyvern is responsible for navigating the target career portal, filling out the application form, and submitting it.
        *   **Security Note:** Communication with Skyvern API is over HTTPS. Sensitive user data is handled securely.
    4.  **Error Handling & Retries (Skyvern):**
        *   The `IntegrationService` (or logic within the task) handles Skyvern API interactions, including retries with exponential backoff for transient issues (e.g., network errors, temporary Skyvern unavailability).
        *   Specific Skyvern errors (e.g., "CAPTCHA required," "application form changed") are logged for review or potential manual intervention.
    5.  **Application Record Creation:** An `Application` record is created in the database with an initial status like "Auto-Applying" or "SubmittedToSkyvern."
    6.  **Log Outcome:** The outcome of the Skyvern submission (success, specific failure reason) is logged against the `Application` record or in a separate audit log.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   An attempt is made to submit the job application via Skyvern.
    *   An `Application` record is created/updated with the submission status.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `Application`, `UserProfile`, `JobListing`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Skyvern API errors (logged, retried if appropriate).
    *   Failures to create/update `Application` record (critical, logged).
    *   If Skyvern indicates a CAPTCHA or other manual intervention is needed, the application status is updated accordingly, and the user might be notified.

**Step 4: Application Status Tracking & User Notification**

*   **Actor:** Jobraker Backend System, Celery Worker (optional status check task), User.
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   An application has been submitted (manually or automatically).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Status Updates (Skyvern):**
        *   **Webhook (Preferred):** If Skyvern supports webhooks, Jobraker exposes an endpoint to receive asynchronous status updates about submitted applications.
        *   **Polling (Fallback):** If webhooks are not available, a scheduled Celery task might periodically poll Skyvern for status updates on pending applications (less efficient).
    2.  **Manual Updates:** Users can also manually update the status of their applications within the Jobraker platform.
    3.  **Database Update:** The `Application` record status is updated in the database (e.g., "Applied," "Application Viewed," "Interview Scheduled," "Offer Received," "Rejected").
    4.  **User Notification:** Users are notified of significant status changes or successful auto-applications via the Notification Flow (see Section 6).
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   `Application` record reflects the latest known status.
    *   User is informed of relevant updates.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `Application`, `Notification`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Errors processing Skyvern webhooks are logged.
    *   Failures in polling Skyvern are logged.

## 5. Conversational AI Assistant Flow

This flow describes user interaction with the AI-powered chat assistant, focusing on context-aware and personalized responses.

**Actors:**
*   **User:** Interacts with the AI assistant.
*   **Jobraker Backend System:** Manages chat messages and orchestrates AI response generation.
*   **Celery Worker:** Generates AI responses asynchronously.
*   **OpenAI API (or similar LLM provider):** Provides language model capabilities.

**Step 1: User Initiates Conversation / Sends Message**

*   **Actor:** User, Jobraker Backend System.
*   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/chat/messages/`
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   User is authenticated.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **User Input:** User sends a query or message through the chat interface (e.g., "What’s the status of my application to Google?", "Find me remote Python developer jobs with a salary over $120k").
    2.  **Request Handling:** The `ChatMessageViewSet` (or similar) receives the POST request.
    3.  **Validation & Persistence:** The user’s message is validated (e.g., for length, content policies), sanitized, and persisted in the `ChatMessage` model. It's linked to the user and a specific conversation thread/ID.
    4.  **Trigger AI Response:** An asynchronous Celery task (`generate_ai_chat_response`) is enqueued with the ID of the new message.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   User's message is saved in the `ChatMessage` table.
    *   An AI response generation task is scheduled.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `ChatMessage`, `User`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Invalid message format or content (400 Bad Request).
    *   Failure to save message (500 Internal Server Error, logged).

**Step 2: AI-Powered Response Generation (RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation)**

*   **Actor:** Celery Worker, Jobraker Backend System, OpenAI API.
*   **Celery Task:** `generate_ai_chat_response`
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   A new user message has been persisted and its ID passed to the task.
    *   Valid OpenAI API credentials are configured.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Contextual Data Retrieval (Retrieval Phase):**
        *   The task retrieves relevant context for the user and their query. This may involve:
            *   Recent conversation history from the `ChatMessage` table for the current thread.
            *   User's `UserProfile` data (preferences, skills).
            *   Status of recent `Application` records.
            *   Relevant `JobListing` data if the query is job-search related.
        *   **OpenAI Embeddings (Optional for RAG):** If a knowledge base of job search advice or common FAQs exists, embeddings can be used to find the most relevant snippets to augment the prompt.
    2.  **Prompt Engineering:** A carefully crafted prompt is constructed for the LLM (e.g., GPT-4.1 Mini). This prompt includes:
        *   The user’s current message.
        *   A summary of relevant conversation history (to maintain context).
        *   The retrieved contextual data (application statuses, job listings, profile snippets).
        *   System instructions defining the AI's role, persona, tone, capabilities, and limitations (e.g., "You are a helpful job assistant. Do not provide financial advice.").
        *   **Function Calling (If applicable):** The prompt might define functions the LLM can "call" to request specific structured data from the Jobraker backend (e.g., `get_application_status(job_id)`). The LLM would then return a request to call this function, the Celery task executes it, and sends the result back to the LLM in a subsequent call.
    3.  **LLM API Call:** The complete prompt is sent to the configured OpenAI API endpoint.
    4.  **Response Generation:** The LLM processes the prompt and generates a response.
    5.  **Response Moderation & Validation (Optional but Recommended):**
        *   The AI’s response can be passed through a content moderation filter (e.g., OpenAI's Moderation API or an internal filter) to check for inappropriate or harmful content.
        *   If the AI claims to provide specific factual data retrieved via function calling, this data can be cross-validated.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   An AI-generated response is formulated.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `ChatMessage`, `UserProfile`, `Application`, `JobListing`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   OpenAI API errors (timeouts, rate limits, authentication failures) are logged, and retries may be implemented.
    *   Errors during contextual data retrieval are logged.
    *   If response generation fails critically, a fallback message may be stored (e.g., "I'm currently unable to respond, please try again later.").

**Step 3: Storing and Delivering AI Response**

*   **Actor:** Celery Worker, Jobraker Backend System, User Client Application.
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   An AI-generated response is available from Step 2.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Persistence:** The AI-generated response is saved as a new message in the `ChatMessage` model, attributed to the 'assistant' role and linked to the same conversation thread.
    2.  **Real-time Delivery (WebSockets):**
        *   If WebSockets are enabled (see Section 8) and the user has an active connection, the new assistant message is pushed to the frontend for immediate display in the chat interface. This is often done by sending an event through Django Channels.
    3.  **Polling (Fallback):** If WebSockets are not used, the frontend may periodically poll an API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/chat/messages/?conversation_id=<id>&since=<timestamp>`) for new messages.

## 6. Proactive Notification Ecosystem Flow

This flow outlines how the system generates and delivers timely and relevant notifications to users across multiple channels.

**Actors:**
*   **Jobraker Backend System:** Identifies notifiable events and creates notification objects.
*   **Celery Worker:** Processes and dispatches notifications.
*   **User:** Receives and interacts with notifications.
*   **External Notification Services:** Email providers (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES), Push Notification gateways (e.g., FCM, APNS).

**Step 1: Event-Driven Notification Triggering**

*   **Actor:** Jobraker Backend System (various components like application management, job matching).
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   A significant event relevant to a user occurs within the system.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Event Identification:** Various system events automatically trigger the creation of notifications. Examples include:
        *   `Application Status Change`: Status of a `Application` record changes (e.g., "Interview Scheduled," "Application Rejected," "Offer Received").
        *   `New Job Recommendation`: A new `JobListing` highly matches a user's `UserProfile` and preferences.
        *   `Auto-Application Success/Failure`: An automated job application is successfully submitted or encounters a critical issue.
        *   `Interview Reminder`: An upcoming interview linked to an `Application` is approaching.
        *   `System Alert`: Important platform-wide announcements or maintenance notices.
    2.  **Notification Object Creation:** When a notifiable event occurs, a `Notification` object is created and persisted in the database.
    3.  **Notification Content:** The `Notification` model stores:
        *   `user_id`: The recipient user.
        *   `message`: The human-readable notification content.
        *   `type`: Category of notification (e.g., `APPLICATION_UPDATE`, `NEW_JOB`, `SYSTEM_ALERT`).
        *   `severity`: Importance level (e.g., `INFO`, `WARNING`, `CRITICAL`).
        *   `read_status`: Boolean, defaults to `false`.
        *   `created_at`: Timestamp.
        *   `payload`: Optional JSON field for additional context or deep-linking information.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   A new `Notification` record is created in the database with `read_status = false`.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `Notification`, `Application`, `JobListing`, `UserProfile`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Failure to create `Notification` record (logged, potential retry if critical).

**Step 2: Multi-Channel Notification Dispatch**

*   **Actor:** Celery Worker (scheduled or event-triggered task), External Notification Services.
*   **Celery Task:** `dispatch_pending_notifications`
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   Unread notifications exist in the database.
    *   User notification preferences (channels, types) are configured in `UserProfile`.
    *   Credentials for external notification services are correctly set up.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Task Trigger:** A scheduled Celery task periodically queries for unread/undelivered notifications. Alternatively, notification creation (Step 1) could directly enqueue a dispatch task for immediate processing for high-priority notifications.
    2.  **Preference Check:** For each notification, the system checks the recipient user's preferences stored in their `UserProfile` (e.g., preferred channels, opt-outs for certain notification types).
    3.  **Channel Selection & Dispatch:** Based on preferences and notification type/severity, the system attempts to dispatch the notification through one or more configured channels:
        *   **In-App Alerts:** If the user is active on the platform, the notification might be pushed via WebSockets or made available via an API endpoint for in-app display.
        *   **Email Notifications:** Formatted emails are sent to the user’s registered email address using an email service (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES). Email templates ensure consistent branding and clear information.
            *   **Performance Note:** Email sending is an I/O-bound operation and should always be handled asynchronously.
        *   **Push Notifications (Mobile/Web):** If the user has opted-in and registered a device/browser for push notifications, messages are sent via appropriate gateways (FCM for Android/Web, APNS for iOS).
    4.  **Delivery Status Logging:** The system logs the delivery attempt and status (e.g., `sent`, `failed`, `bounced`) for each channel. For critical notifications, persistent failures might trigger alerts for administrators.
    5.  **Update Notification Record:** The `Notification` record might be updated to reflect that a dispatch attempt was made.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   Notifications are dispatched via appropriate channels based on user preferences.
    *   Delivery attempts are logged.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `Notification`, `UserProfile`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Errors from external notification services (API errors, invalid recipient) are logged. Retries may be implemented for transient errors.
    *   User has opted out of the specific notification type/channel (skipped).
    *   Invalid email address or push token (logged, potentially flag user profile for review).

**Step 3: User Accesses and Manages Notifications**

*   **Actor:** User, Jobraker Backend System.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /api/v1/notifications/` (to retrieve a list of notifications, with filters for read/unread)
    *   `PATCH /api/v1/notifications/{notification_id}/mark-as-read/`
    *   `PATCH /api/v1/notifications/mark-all-as-read/`
    *   `GET /api/v1/users/profile/notification-settings/` (to view preferences)
    *   `PUT /api/v1/users/profile/notification-settings/` (to update preferences)
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   User is authenticated.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Retrieve Notifications:** Users can fetch a list of their notifications (both read and unread) via an API endpoint. The list is typically paginated and sorted by date.
    2.  **Mark as Read:** Users can mark individual notifications or all notifications as read. This updates the `read_status` in the `Notification` model.
    3.  **Manage Preferences:** Users can access a settings area to configure their notification preferences (e.g., enable/disable specific types of notifications, choose preferred delivery channels). These preferences are saved in their `UserProfile`.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   User can view their notifications.
    *   `read_status` of notifications is updated.
    *   User notification preferences are updated in `UserProfile`.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `Notification`, `UserProfile`.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Notification not found (404 Not Found for specific ID operations).
    *   Invalid preference settings (400 Bad Request).

## 7. Platform Administration & Oversight Flow

This flow describes how administrators (Admins) manage the Jobraker platform, its users, content, and monitor its health.

**Actors:**
*   **Administrator (Admin):** A privileged user with specific staff/superuser permissions.
*   **Jobraker Backend System:** Provides the admin interface and backend logic for admin operations.

**Step 1: Secure Admin Authentication**

*   **Actor:** Administrator, Jobraker Backend System.
*   **Admin Interface:** Typically Django Admin, enhanced with `django-jazzmin` for improved UI/UX.
*   **Authentication URL:** e.g., `/admin/login/`
*   **API Endpoint (if a separate admin API exists):** `POST /api/v1/admin/auth/login/`
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   Admin user account exists with appropriate permissions (`is_staff=True`, `is_superuser=True`, or specific group permissions).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Login Attempt:** Administrators log in using their dedicated credentials (username/password).
    2.  **Security Measures:**
        *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Strongly recommended and should be enforced for all admin accounts (e.g., using `django-otp`).
        *   **IP Whitelisting/VPN:** Access to the admin interface may be restricted to specific IP addresses or require VPN access for an additional layer of security.
        *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforced for admin accounts.
    3.  **Session Management:** Admin sessions are managed by Django's session framework or JWTs if a separate admin API is used. Session timeouts are configured appropriately.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   Administrator is authenticated and gains access to the admin interface/API.
    *   Admin login activity is logged for auditing.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** `User` (checking `is_staff`, `is_superuser`), potentially 2FA models.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Invalid credentials (admin login form error).
    *   2FA failure.
    *   Access denied due to IP restrictions.

**Step 2: Comprehensive Data Management Capabilities**

*   **Actor:** Administrator, Jobraker Backend System.
*   **Admin Interface:** Django Admin (`django-jazzmin`).
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   Administrator is authenticated and has necessary permissions for specific data models.
*   **Process (via Admin UI):**
    *   **User Management:**
        *   View, search, and filter user lists (`User`, `UserProfile`).
        *   Inspect individual user profiles, including their job applications, auto-apply settings, and chat history (with appropriate privacy considerations and audit trails).
        *   Perform actions: password resets, account activation/deactivation/suspension, manual verification, editing profile details.
    *   **Job Listing Management:**
        *   View, search, filter, add, edit, or remove `JobListing` records.
        *   Curate featured jobs or manually approve listings from new sources.

    *   **Application Oversight:**
        *   View all `Application` records, filter by status, user, job, or date.
        *   Potentially intervene in problematic applications (e.g., manually update status if an external system fails to report).
    *   **Content Moderation:**
        *   Review and manage user-generated content (if any, e.g., profile descriptions, forum posts - if such features exist).
        *   Review AI chat logs for quality assurance, identify problematic interactions, or gather feedback for AI model fine-tuning (requires clear user consent and privacy policies).
    *   **Notification Management:**
        *   View system-generated `Notification` records.
        *   Potentially create and dispatch manual system-wide announcements.

*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   Data records are managed (created, updated, deleted) by the administrator.
    *   Platform configurations may be updated.
    *   All admin actions are logged for auditing.
*   **Key Data Models Involved:** All major models (`User`, `UserProfile`, `JobListing`, `Application`, `ChatMessage`, `Notification`, etc.).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Data validation errors on save (displayed in admin forms).
    *   Permission denied errors if an admin attempts an action beyond their scope.

**Step 3: System Monitoring & Analytics (Admin Perspective)**

## 8. Real-Time & Task-Oriented Architecture Flow

This section details the asynchronous processing and real-time communication capabilities of the backend, crucial for performance and user experience.

**Actors:**
*   **Jobraker Backend System:** Core application logic.
*   **Celery Beat:** Scheduler for periodic tasks.
*   **Celery Workers:** Distributed task executors.
*   **Message Broker (Redis/RabbitMQ):** Facilitates communication between web servers and Celery workers.
*   **Django Channels / ASGI Server (Daphne):** Manages WebSocket connections.
*   **User Client Application:** Interacts in real-time.

**Step 1: Asynchronous Task Scheduling & Distributed Execution with Celery**

*   **Actor:** Celery Beat, Celery Workers, Message Broker, Jobraker Backend System.
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   Celery, Celery Beat, and workers are configured and running.
    *   Message broker (Redis or RabbitMQ) is operational.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Task Definition:** Long-running, I/O-bound, or computationally intensive operations are defined as Celery tasks (e.g., `fetch_external_jobs`, `process_auto_applications_for_user`, `generate_ai_chat_response`, `dispatch_pending_notifications`, `parse_resume`).
    *   **Task Enqueueing:**
        *   **Periodic Tasks:** `Celery Beat` schedules tasks based on predefined intervals (e.g., cron-like schedules) defined in Django settings or a Celery Beat dynamic schedule configuration. It sends messages to the broker to trigger these tasks.
        *   **Event-Driven Tasks:** Django application code (e.g., in API views or model signals) enqueues tasks by sending a message to the broker (e.g., `my_task.delay(arg1, arg2)` or `my_task.apply_async(args=[arg1, arg2], queue='specific_queue')`).
    *   **Message Broker:** Receives task messages and holds them in appropriate queues.
    *   **Task Consumption & Execution:**
        *   `Celery Workers` (one or more processes, potentially on different machines) continuously monitor specific queues in the message broker.
        *   When a task message appears in a queue a worker is subscribed to, the worker retrieves it and executes the corresponding task function with the provided arguments.
    *   **Task Queues & Prioritization:**
        *   Different Celery queues are established based on task priority, resource requirements, or execution time characteristics (e.g., `high_priority_notifications`, `default_processing`, `cpu_intensive_jobs`, `io_bound_integrations`).
        *   This prevents, for example, a long-running report generation task from blocking quick notification dispatches.
        *   **Performance Note:** Workers can be configured to consume from one or more queues, allowing for dedicated worker pools for different types of tasks.
    *   **Error Handling & Retries in Tasks:**
        *   Celery tasks implement robust error handling (try-except blocks).
        *   Automatic retry mechanisms (with configurable policies like exponential backoff and max retries) are used for transient failures (e.g., temporary network issues when calling external APIs).
        *   **Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs):** Tasks that fail repeatedly (exceeding max retries) can be routed to a DLQ for manual inspection and potential re-processing or debugging.
    *   **Result Backend (Optional):** Celery can be configured with a result backend (e.g., Redis or database) to store the status and return values of tasks, allowing the application to query task outcomes if needed.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   Asynchronous tasks are executed reliably and efficiently in the background.
    *   API responsiveness is maintained by offloading heavy work.
*   **Key Components:** Celery, Message Broker (Redis/RabbitMQ), Celery Beat.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Task execution errors are logged (e.g., to Sentry).
    *   Broker connection issues (workers may retry connection).
    *   Failures after max retries are handled (e.g., DLQ, logging, admin alert).

**Step 2: Real-Time User Interaction with Django Channels (WebSockets)**

*   **Actor:** User Client Application, Django Channels / ASGI Server (Daphne), Jobraker Backend System.
*   **Pre-conditions:**
    *   Django Channels is configured in the project.
    *   An ASGI application server (e.g., Daphne) is used to handle WebSocket traffic (alongside a WSGI server like Gunicorn for standard HTTP requests, or Daphne can handle both).
    *   Frontend client is capable of establishing WebSocket connections.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Connection Establishment:**
        1.  User's client application initiates a WebSocket connection to a specific endpoint defined in Django Channels routing configuration (e.g., `ws://jobraker.com/ws/notifications/` or `ws://jobraker.com/ws/chat/<conversation_id>/`).
        2.  The ASGI server (Daphne) handles the WebSocket handshake.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:**
        *   WebSocket connections are authenticated. This can be done during the handshake (e.g., by passing a JWT in a query parameter or subprotocol) or via an initial message over the established WebSocket.
        *   Django Channels consumers authorize the connection based on the authenticated user and the requested channel/group.
    *   **Channel Layers & Groups:**
        *   Django Channels uses a "channel layer" (typically backed by Redis) to enable communication between different parts of the application (e.g., between an HTTP view handling a POST request and a WebSocket consumer, or between a Celery task and a consumer).
        *   Consumers can subscribe WebSocket connections to "groups" (e.g., a user-specific group like `user_{user_id}_notifications`, or a chat-specific group like `chat_{conversation_id}`).
    *   **Bi-directional Communication:**
        *   **Server-to-Client:** When a relevant event occurs in the backend (e.g., a Celery task completes AI response generation, a new notification is created), the backend code can send a message to the appropriate group on the channel layer. All WebSocket consumers subscribed to that group will receive the message and forward it to their connected clients.
        *   **Client-to-Server (Less common for these use cases, more for interactive chat input):** Clients can send messages over the WebSocket to the server. The corresponding consumer processes these messages (e.g., a new chat message sent via WebSocket instead of HTTP POST).
    *   **Use Cases:**
        *   **Live AI Chat Updates:** When `generate_ai_chat_response` task completes, it sends the AI's message to the `chat_{conversation_id}` group. The user's client, connected to this group, receives and displays the message instantly.
        *   **Real-Time Notifications:** When `dispatch_pending_notifications` processes an in-app alert, it sends the notification data to the `user_{user_id}_notifications` group.
        *   **Live Application Status Updates:** If an application status changes (e.g., via a webhook from Skyvern), the handler can send an update to the relevant user's group.
    *   **Connection Management:** Consumers handle WebSocket connect, disconnect, and receive events. State can be managed within the consumer or using the channel layer/database.
*   **Post-conditions:**
    *   User clients receive real-time updates for relevant events without needing to poll the server.
    *   Interactive, bi-directional communication is enabled for features like live chat.
*   **Key Components:** Django Channels, ASGI Server (Daphne), Channel Layer (Redis).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   WebSocket connection failures (client-side retries).
    *   Authentication/authorization failures for WebSocket connections.
    *   Errors sending messages over the channel layer (logged).
    *   Consumer exceptions (logged, potentially disconnect client).

```

**Diagram Legend & Flow Explanation:**

1.  **User Client (Frontend):** Initiates requests (HTTP/S for REST API, WebSocket for real-time) to the backend.
2.  **API Gateway / Load Balancer (LB):** (e.g., Render's LB, Nginx, Envoy) Distributes incoming HTTP/S traffic to Django Web Servers (Gunicorn). Handles SSL/TLS termination. May also route WebSocket traffic to the ASGI Server if configured.
3.  **Django Web Servers (WSGI - Gunicorn):**
    *   Process synchronous HTTP API requests using Django REST Framework (DRF).
    *   Handle user authentication (including OAuth via `django-allauth`).
    *   Serve the Django Admin interface (`django-jazzmin`).
    *   Interact with the `Service Layer` for business logic.
    *   Communicate with `PostgreSQL` via Django ORM for data persistence.
    *   Offload long-running tasks to `Celery Workers` by sending messages to the `Message Broker`.
    *   Interact with `Redis` for caching and session management.
4.  **ASGI Server (Daphne):**
    *   Handles WebSocket connections managed by `Django Channels`.
    *   Can also serve HTTP traffic if configured as the primary server.
5.  **Django Channels:** Manages WebSocket lifecycle (connect, disconnect, message handling) via consumers. Uses the `Channel Layer` (backed by Redis) for inter-process communication (e.g., workers sending messages to connected clients).
6.  **Service Layer:** Contains core business logic, decoupled from Django views/Celery tasks. Interacts with ORM and may trigger async tasks.
7.  **PostgreSQL (+ pgvector):** Primary relational database storing all persistent application data, including vector embeddings for semantic search.
8.  **Celery Beat:** A scheduler process that periodically triggers defined tasks by sending messages to the `Message Broker`.
9.  **Message Broker (Redis / RabbitMQ):** Manages queues of task messages, decoupling task producers (web servers, Celery Beat) from task consumers (`Celery Workers`).
10. **Celery Workers:** Execute asynchronous background tasks. They fetch tasks from the `Message Broker`, interact with `PostgreSQL`, `Redis`, and `External Services` as required.
11. **Redis:** Multi-purpose in-memory store used for:
    *   Caching (API responses, query results).
    *   Celery Broker and Backend (task queues and results).
    *   Session Store (optional).
    *   Django Channels Layer backend.
12. **External Services:** Third-party APIs (Adzuna, Skyvern, OpenAI, Email services) integrated into the system, typically accessed by `Celery Workers` or the `Service Layer`.

**Key Communication Paths:**
*   **Solid Arrows (`---->` or `<====>`):** Primary request/data flow.
*   **HTTP/S:** Standard web communication.
*   **WebSocket:** Real-time bi-directional communication.
*   **Django ORM:** Interaction with PostgreSQL.
*   **Celery Messaging:** Interaction with the Message Broker.
*   **Channel Layer:** Communication for WebSocket broadcasts.

## 10. Security, Scalability, and Reliability Considerations

This section details the strategies and practices implemented to ensure the Jobraker platform is secure, scalable, and reliable. These are cross-cutting concerns that influence the design of all flows and components.

*   **Security:**
    *   **Transport Layer Security (TLS):** HTTPS (TLS 1.3 or higher) is enforced for all external communications (API, WebSockets, external service calls) to encrypt data in transit.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:**
        *   Robust JWT-based authentication with short-lived access tokens and secure refresh token handling (e.g., `HttpOnly` cookies).
        *   OAuth 2.0 integration with trusted providers.
        *   Granular permissions at the API level (DRF) and for admin actions.
        *   Strong password policies and 2FA for administrators.
    *   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Rigorous validation of all user inputs (API requests, form submissions) using DRF serializers and custom validation logic to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, Command Injection). Output encoding is applied where necessary.
    *   **OWASP Top 10 Mitigation:** Conscious effort to address common web application vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Secure storage and management of sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, encryption keys) using platform features (e.g., Render Environment Groups, HashiCorp Vault, or similar). Secrets are not hardcoded.
    *   **Data-at-Rest Encryption:**
        *   Database-level encryption for PostgreSQL (managed by Render).
        *   Encryption of sensitive files (e.g., resumes) using AES-256 before storing in object storage.
        *   Column-level encryption for extremely sensitive fields in the database (e.g., external service credentials) using libraries like `django-fernet-fields`.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Regular scanning of third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `pip-audit`, Snyk).
    *   **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Implemented at the API gateway or within DRF to protect against denial-of-service attacks and abuse.
    *   **Security Headers:** Use of appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`).
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Planned periodic security code reviews and penetration testing.

*   **Scalability:**
    *   **Horizontal Scaling:**
        *   Stateless application servers (Django web servers running Gunicorn) allow for easy horizontal scaling by adding more instances behind a load balancer.
        *   Celery worker fleets can be scaled horizontally by adding more worker processes/machines, with workers potentially specialized for different queues.
    *   **Asynchronous Architecture:** Extensive use of Celery for offloading tasks ensures that the synchronous API layer remains responsive and can handle a higher throughput of requests.
    *   **Database Scalability:**
        *   Optimized queries and proper indexing (including `pgvector` for efficient ANN searches).
        *   Connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer) to manage database connections efficiently.
        *   Option for PostgreSQL read replicas to offload read-heavy workloads if needed in the future.
    *   **Efficient Caching:** Aggressive caching strategies using Redis for frequently accessed data, API responses, and session information to reduce database load and improve latency.
    *   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Serving static assets (JS, CSS, images) and user-uploaded media (resumes) via a CDN to reduce load on application servers and improve delivery speed for global users.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Render's load balancer distributes traffic across available web server instances.

*   **Reliability & Fault Tolerance:**
    *   **Managed Services:** Leveraging Render's managed services for PostgreSQL and Redis reduces operational burden related to backups, patching, and high availability.
    *   **Idempotent Task Design:** Critical Celery tasks are designed to be idempotent where possible, ensuring that retrying a task due to a transient failure does not result in unintended side effects (e.g., duplicate applications).
    *   **Robust Error Handling & Retries:**
        *   Comprehensive error handling in application code (API views, Celery tasks, service objects).
        *   Automatic retries with exponential backoff for transient failures in Celery tasks and when interacting with external services.
        *   Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs) for Celery tasks that consistently fail, allowing for manual inspection and intervention.
    *   **Health Checks:** All services expose health check endpoints (e.g., `/healthz/`) that are monitored by the hosting platform (Render) to automatically restart unhealthy instances.
    *   **Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring:**
        *   Structured logging across all components, aggregated into a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Logtail).
        *   Real-time monitoring of key application and system metrics (latency, error rates, queue lengths, resource utilization) using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
        *   Distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) can be integrated for deeper insights into request flows across services.
    *   **Alerting:** Proactive alerting configured for critical errors, performance degradation, or resource exhaustion, notifying the operations team.
    *   **Automated Backups:** Regular, automated backups for PostgreSQL (provided by Render) with tested recovery procedures.
    *   **Graceful Degradation:** Designing the system so that non-critical features can degrade gracefully or be temporarily disabled during partial outages or high load, preserving core functionality.
    *   **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Implemented in the `IntegrationService` for calls to external services to prevent cascading failures if an external service becomes unresponsive.
